     Hello, i am a cyber security student who loves learning new codes and prgrams
    

    <h3>PROJECT 2</h3>
 <br><p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, devices, and data from cyber threats, which can include hacking, data breaches, malware, phishing, and other malicious activities. It encompasses a wide range of tools, practices, principles, and technologies designed to secure digital infrastructure and data, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Here's a comprehensive overview of cybersecurity, broken down into key concepts, types of threats, defense strategies, and current trends

 <h3>PROJECT 3</h3>
     <li>
     	1. Core Principles of Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity aims to maintain three key principles, often referred to as the CIA Triad:

Confidentiality: Ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to those authorized to view it. For example, data encryption is often used to protect confidentiality.

Integrity: Ensuring that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered unless authorized. Mechanisms like hashing and checksums are used to verify data integrity.

Availability: Ensuring that systems and data are available and accessible to authorized users when needed. This can involve ensuring redundancy, failover systems, and protection from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
     </li>
          
     <li>
     	Information Security

Protecting data in all formsâ€”whether it's stored on a device or in transit.
Encryption is one of the key methods used to secure sensitive data, ensuring that even if intercepted, it cannot be understood by unauthorized parties.

     </li>

     <li>
     	Application Security

Ensuring that software applications are secure from threats throughout their lifecycle.
Developers use security practices like secure coding, regular updates, vulnerability scanning, and patch management to protect applications from threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities.
     </li>


     <li>

     	Endpoint Security
Protecting individual devices (endpoints) that connect to a network, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
Antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, and mobile device management (MDM) systems are used to protect these devices from malware, ransomware, and unauthorized access.

     </li>

     <li>
     	Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning
Ensuring that organizations can quickly recover from a cyberattack or system failure.
Backup systems, redundancy, and incident response plans are used to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of an attack or disaster.
